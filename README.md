# ParityTech Roadmap

GitHub Action + Octokit application, which generates `roadmap.json` from the GH Project and deploys this to https://paritytech.github.io/roadmap/roadmap.json every 9:00 and 21:00 each day
The authentication to Octokit on production is done through the GitHub action, where we generate token from GitHub App.
In order to test it locally - generate [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)
